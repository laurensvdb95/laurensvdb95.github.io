                   <p class="inleiding">My biggest passion is basketball. I started playing when i was 6 years old and i keep loving it more and more.</p>
                   <h2>My story in basketball</h2>
                   <p>When I was 6 years old there was a small basketball training in the gym of my village for kids who wanted to get to know the sport.
                   I decided to go to this practice and I loved it so much that I became a member of the club. I played for several clubs in the past 19 years but now I went back to my roots
                    and I went back to the team where I started playing the game. At the age of 16 I decided I wanted to become a coach because I also love it to bring my passion for the sport to kids and to teach them how to become a good player.</p>
                   <h2>My favourite team</h2>
                   <p>Like every basketball player I'm a big fan of the NBA (National Basketball Association). This is the most famous basketball competition in the world with stars like Michael Jordan in the past and Lebron James at the moment.
                      My favourite team are the Dallas Mavericks because the first NBA game I ever saw was a game of the Mavs and they played so great that I became a fan and i Stayed it for already 16 years now.</p>
