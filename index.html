                   <p class="inleiding">I am Laurens Vandenbergh, I am 25 years old and I live in Betekom.</p>
                   <p>I love sports, more specific basketball. I will tell more about it on the hobbypage. At high school I studied Sports & science. Afterwards I studied legal practice and I started working in a notary office.
                   after one year i decided to change to real estate. Because i came in contact with the maintaince of the website i decided i wanted to become a developer. Because of this i went to Syntra to become a full stack developer
                    and i am looking forward to the Switchfully training to learn more about development. </p>
